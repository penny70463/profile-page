### Challenges I've faced 

#### Common Issues When Deploying A Nuxt.js Project On Netlify

- [x] npm run build works on local but got this error when deploying

````js
FATAL ERROR: Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory
````
 [solution works for me](https://answers.netlify.com/t/build-command-javascript-heap-out-of-memory/85348/6)
 
- [x] I got 404 after deployment finished 

 [solution works for me](https://answers.netlify.com/t/netlify-returns-404-for-ssr-nuxt-website/99741/10)

- [x] my avatar got 404
 
 Nuxt Image doesnâ€™t seem to be directly compatible with Netlify, so I used <img /> directly for static directory.

#### Other Issues 

- [x] environment variables

I have failed to access environment variables on Netlify many times. It turns out that I needed to add "NUXT_ENV".
 [solution works for me](https://zain-ahmed-5360.medium.com/how-to-config-env-variables-in-nuxt-js-with-heroku-and-netlify-adfcdde6c6cf)

- [ ] Unchecked runtime.lastError: The message port closed before a response was received.

- [ ] Got "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy policy would block the window.close call." when logging with Google.
